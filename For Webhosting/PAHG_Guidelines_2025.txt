To make the index.bs file publicly accessible at https://www.pahgncb.com/index.bs as per the NGDC's guidelines, follow these steps. This assumes you have control over your website’s server configuration or access to your web hosting service.

1) Move index.bs to the site root

You need to place the index.bs file in the root directory of your web server. This step makes it accessible via the URL: https://www.pahgncb.com/index.bs.

For example:

If your website is hosted on a web server, move index.bs to the root folder of your website. The root folder is usually the main public directory where index.html or other main files are stored.

To move the index.bs file to the root directory:

If you're using an FTP client: Open the root folder and upload index.bs directly there.

If you have SSH access: You can move it manually via command line:

# Move the index.bs file to the root directory of your web server (adjust path as needed)
mv /mnt/e/pahg_bigsearch/index.bs /var/www/html/index.bs

Note: /var/www/html/ is a common root directory for Apache web servers. This path may vary based on your server setup. If you’re using a different web server, such as Nginx or a custom solution, the root directory may differ (e.g., /usr/share/nginx/html/ for Nginx).

2) Ensure Public Accessibility

After the file is moved to the root directory, you need to ensure that your server allows public access to the file.

For Apache:

Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf).

Make sure the <Directory> block for your web root has the correct permissions:

<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>

Reload the Apache server:

sudo systemctl reload apache2

For Nginx:

Open the Nginx configuration file (usually located at /etc/nginx/sites-available/default).

Ensure that the configuration for your root directory allows public access:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.pahgncb.com;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

Reload the Nginx server:

sudo systemctl reload nginx

For Custom Hosting:

If you're using a custom cloud hosting provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, or any other web hosting service), ensure you upload the index.bs file into the correct directory that’s publicly accessible via HTTP.

After uploading, check the file URL https://www.pahgncb.com/index.bs to confirm it’s accessible.

3) Check the Accessibility

Once the file is placed at the root of the server and publicly accessible, open your web browser and visit:

https://www.pahgncb.com/index.bs

If the file is correctly placed and permissions are set, you should see the contents of the index.bs file.

4) Test Access

You can test this externally by using curl or any HTTP request tool to make sure the file is accessible:

curl -I https://www.pahgncb.com/index.bs

You should get a 200 OK response if the file is correctly hosted.

Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
